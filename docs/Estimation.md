# Estimation approach

<Consider the EZGas  project as described in YOUR requirement document, assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course>

# Estimate by product decomposition



### 

|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |  
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed   |        15                     |             
|  A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       |              50              | 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A) |250 |
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  |                  960 hours : each person 24 hours, 4 persons in the team, 240*4 = 960                    |   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) |2880 euro| 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) |           1.5         |
