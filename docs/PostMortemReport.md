Consider the EZGas project and provide your thoughts after completing it. 
Distinguish between what you could not change (requirements, tools, timing, team selection, etc) 
and what was under your control (team organization, available skills, communication tools, etc).
Also this document will not be used for evaluations, but for improving the project approach for the coming year.


# Best things
- Team selection based on the system and skills. 
- One week sprints for deliveries is enough and appropriate.
- Using Git for configuration management.
- Using Slack for communication with professor.

# Worst things
- GUI testing with SikuliX software is impractical in the real world projects.



# Suggestions 
- For GUI testing, insted of using the SikuliX, testing the software with a tester human sounds more practical and we can check the UX testing at the same time.
